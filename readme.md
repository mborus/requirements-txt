Python Jupyterlab and friends "requirements.txt" for Windows 10
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This repo allows you to quickly setup a Jupyterlab with Geopandas environment on Windows from a requirements.txt file with pip. 
It also installs a bunch of other things, from pytest to FastAPI - mainly everything I need to have with me to setup a Python environment offline.

ðŸ‘‰ This repo is mostly meant for my own use, your milage may vary

ðŸ‘‰ Main reason why this exists: pip includes a download feature which allows convenient installations from a USB drive with no internet present

ðŸ‘‰ You think some library is missing? Cool! Please open an issue.


# Instructions #

Install Python
--------------
Get it from https://www.python.org/ - currently it's Version 3.11.3

Install it for all users if you can, if not, just for you.

Go with the defaults. (Do not select to add it on the Path, it's not necessary)


Create a virtual directory
--------------------------

Whereever you want it:

- Open "cmd.exe".
- Navigate with "cd" commands to where you want to create it
- Run "py -3 -m venv <global_venv>" (where <global venv> stands for the name you want to give it)


Activate the virtual directory
------------------------------
- Open "cmd.exe".
- Navigate with "cd" commands into the virtual directory you created in the last step
- run "Scripts/activate" to activate it (The names should autocomplete, type "S"-[Tab]-"a"-[Tab][Enter])


Install everthing else
----------------------
Inside "cmd.exe" navigate to where you compied the files from this repo
With the activated virtual directory, run
"python -m pip install pip -U"
then
"python -m pip install -r requirements.txt"


Start Jupyter
----------------------
Inside "cmd.exe", with the still activated virtual directory  
run "start python -m jupyterlab"
This first opens a new cmd window and then starts Jupyterlab in your browser.


Offline use
-----------
Copy everything needed onto a USB drive with the command
python -m pip download -r requirements.txt

Then later install from within that folder
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --no-index --find-links .
